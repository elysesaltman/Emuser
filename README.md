#Title:
Emuser

##Description
My first project utilizing a bootstrap foundation as a very simple site.

- What was your motivation?
I've created and reviewed many resumes for close friends and family over the years. My focus was to create a mock up front end template website.
- Why did you build this project?
Ideally I would like to get this project to a point where an end user can fill out fields for a resume, which will in turn create a Word/PDF file in a presentable template for practical use.
- What did you learn?
Typography, front end visuals, color schemes, bootstrap, HTML/CSS
